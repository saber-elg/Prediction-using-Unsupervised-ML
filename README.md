# 🌸 Iris Flower Clustering with K-Means
🚀 Unsupervised Machine Learning in Action

This project demonstrates how K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, can be applied to the Iris dataset to uncover natural groupings among iris flowers based on their characteristics.

## 📌 Project Overview
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning. It consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, each described by four features:
✔ Sepal Length <br>
✔ Sepal Width <br>
✔ Petal Length <br>
✔ Petal Width <br>

The dataset is categorized into three species:
🌿 Iris-setosa <br>
🌿 Iris-versicolour <br>
🌿 Iris-virginica <br>

In this project, we use K-Means clustering to automatically group the flowers into three clusters based on their feature similarities.

## ⚙️ Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:

🔹 Python 3.x <br>
🔹 NumPy (pip install numpy) <br>
🔹 Pandas (pip install pandas) <br>
🔹 Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)<br>
🔹 Scikit-learn (pip install scikit-learn) <br>

You can install all dependencies at once using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## ▶️ Running the Project
Follow these steps to clone and run the project:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-ML.git
cd Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML
```
### 2️⃣ Run the Script
```bash
python main.py
```
## 📊 What Happens When You Run the Script?
✅ Loads the Iris dataset <br>
✅ Determines the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method <br>
✅ Applies K-Means clustering to classify iris flowers into three clusters <br>
✅ Visualizes the clusters and their centroids <br>

By executing main.py, you'll see how K-Means clustering groups the iris flowers based on their features, revealing natural patterns in the data.
